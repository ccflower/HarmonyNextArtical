# Distributed Authentication: "Trust Expressway" with Device Linkage

hello!I am Xiao L, the female programmer who "built a bridge" in the Hongmeng distributed certification system~ Have you ever thought that when you unlock your home with your mobile phone, the air conditioner at home has "know you" and automatically adjusted the temperature?This is the "magic" of Hongmeng distributed authentication - making the trust transfer between devices as smooth as a highway.Today we will disassemble this "cross-device trust universe" ~


## 1. Distributed authentication: "Crisis of Trust" and "Breakthrough" between devices

### (I) Three "trust dilemmas"
1. **Status out of synchronization: "Information Time Difference" between devices**
- Scenario: After you use your mobile phone to authenticate, you want to continue operating through the tablet, but the tablet says "Who are you?" - because the authentication status has not been synchronized~
- Consequence: Users need to repeat authentication, and the experience is as bad as "traffic jam".

2. **Cross-device impostor: Hacker's "camouflage"**
- Risk: After a hacker hijacks a device, he disguises himself as your "trusted device" and secretly accesses the data of other devices ~
- Analogy: The thief picked up the keys of your house and wanted to walk away from the things in your car.

3. **Permission chaos: "Tug of permissions" between devices**
- Problem: The mobile phone is authenticated with "ordinary permissions", but the tablet gives "administrator permissions" - the permissions are not unified, and security vulnerabilities are like "bottomless pits" ~

### (II) Hongmeng’s “Trust Infrastructure”
1. **Distributed soft bus: "encrypted express delivery" of authentication information**
- Principle: The "encryption channel" is established between the devices through the soft bus, and the authentication information is like "SF Express", full encryption + real-time tracking~
- Technical point: Use the ECDH algorithm to dynamically generate session keys, and change to a "lock" for each communication, and hackers can't keep up with the rhythm at all~

2. **Distributed Database: "Synchronous Ledger" for Authentication Status**
- Mechanism: After user authentication, the status is written to multiple "ledgers" such as mobile phone, tablet, cloud, etc. at the same time, just like bank transfer, all ledgers are updated at the same time~
- Anti-malfunction: Even if a device "strikes", the ledger of other devices is still there, and the authentication status will not be lost~


## 2. Cross-device certification: from "single-soldier combat" to "group army combat"

### (I) "Trust Chain" Construction: "Identity Introduction Letter" between devices
1. ** Equipment Certificate System: Equipment's "electronic ID card"**
- Each device has a unique certificate (including public key) when it leaves the factory, just like human DNA, unique~
- Certification process:
     ```plaintext
Want to access the tablet on your phone → Show the certificate (public key) on your phone → Verify the tablet with the root certificate → Verify and establish a trust chain
     ```

2. **User Authentication Token: "Permission" across devices**
- After the mobile phone authentication is successful, a "token" (including user ID, permissions, validity period) is generated and transmitted to the tablet via the soft bus~
- After the tablet gets the token, sign it first (using the mobile phone public key), then check the validity period, and then "release" after confirming that it is correct~
   ```typescript
// Token generation and verification pseudo code
// Mobile: Generate tokens
const token = {
       userId: 'user_001',
       permissions: ['read', 'write'],
expires: Date.now() + 3600*1000, // Valid for 1 hour
signature: crypto.sign(private key, JSON.stringify({ userId, permissions, expires }))
   };

// Tablet: Verify token
function verification token (token) {
const valid = token.expires > Date.now();
Const Signature Correct = crypto.verify(Mobile Public Key, Token.signature, JSON.stringify({
userId: token.userId,
permissions: token.permissions,
expires: token.expires
       }));
return valid && Signature correct;
   }
   ```

### (II) "Insensitivity Certification" Scenario: "Silk Experience" of Trust Transmission
1. **Family scenario: "One person certification, whole family equipment release"**
- After you unlock with your mobile phone fingerprint, the TV, speaker, and air conditioner will automatically synchronize the authentication status:
- TV: Play directly the drama you didn't finish watching last time (no need to log in to the video app again)
- Speaker: Play music according to your preferences (no need to verify the account again)
- Security mechanism: The device must be bound on the same LAN + to prevent the neighbor's equipment from "removing trust" ~

2. **Office scenario: "Computer certification, tablet/mobile phone relay"**
- After you use password + UKey authentication on your company's computer, your tablet and mobile phone will automatically gain "temporary trust":
- Tablet: Direct access to shared documents (no secondary authentication is required)
- Mobile phone: Can be approved (permissions are consistent with computer)
- Timeout strategy: After leaving the computer for 30 minutes, the tablet/mobile phone trust will automatically expire to prevent the device from being used after it is lost ~


## 3. Technical Highlights: The "black technology combination" of distributed authentication

### (I) Dynamic permission mapping: the device's "Permission Translator"
1. **Different devices, permissions "adapt to local conditions"**
- Mobile phone: touch screen + fingerprint, suitable for small payment (permission: single transaction ≤1,000 yuan)
- Tablet: keyboard + stylus, suitable for document editing (Permissions: Read and write corporate documents)
- Computer: UKey+face, suitable for large-scale transfers (Permissions: No limit on credit limit)
   ```typescript
// Permission Mapping Table
const device permission map = {
       'phone_001': ['pay_small', 'read_doc'],
       'pad_002': ['edit_doc', 'approve_flow'],
       'pc_003': ['pay_large', 'admin']
   };

// Dynamically adjust permissions according to device type
function get device permissions (device ID) {
return Device permission map [device ID] || [];
   }
   ```

2. **Sensitive operation "cross-device review"**
- When you initiate a large amount of money transfer on your mobile phone, the system will automatically trigger "Computer Review":
- Mobile phone display: "Please confirm on your computer"
- The computer pops up the confirmation window: "Did you have received a mobile phone transfer request, is it approved?"
- Principle: Through the distributed event bus, secondary authentication is triggered across devices to prevent a single device from being attacked ~

### (II) Device group: Trusted "Friends Group"
1. **Group by scenario: "Work Equipment" vs "Home Equipment"**
- Work group: computer, tablet, enterprise WeChat equipment, only enterprise resources can be accessed after authentication~
- Family group: mobile phone, TV, smart speaker, can control the home after certification~
- Isolation mechanism: The authentication status of the two groups is not interoperable, preventing home equipment from leaking work data ~

2. **Temporary Group: "One-time Trust" to prevent abuse**
- Scene: You use your friend’s tablet to work temporarily, create a “temporary group”, and it will disperse after use~
- process:
     ```plaintext
Scan the QR code to join the temporary group → After the authentication is successful, the tablet will obtain "2-hour temporary permission"
Once the time comes, the group will be automatically exited and the permissions will be cleared~
     ```


## 4. Practical cases: "Flooring Position" of distributed authentication

### (I) Smart healthcare: "Life Data Protection" across devices
In a hospital distributed system, after the doctor uses a computer to authenticate, the handheld terminal and monitor automatically trust:
- Computer: View the patient's complete medical record (requires UKey+face certification)
- Handheld terminal: Quickly record the condition by the bed (inheriting the computer's authentication status, no need to log in repeatedly)
- Monitor: Automatically push abnormal data to the doctor terminal (only available for verification)
*Security Results*: Avoid frequent login by medical staff, and prevent patient data from being accessed by unauthenticated devices ~

### (II) Smart car-mounted: the "Triangle of Trust" of "people-car-home"
When you drive home:
1. **Car certification**: Fingerprint starts the car, the system recognizes that you are the "car owner"
2. **Trust transfer**: The car notifies the smart door locks and air conditioners at home through the soft bus
3. **Home experience**: The door lock is automatically unlocked when the car door is opened, and the air conditioner is adjusted to your "exclusive temperature"
*Technical key*: Cars and home devices are bound through the "Hongmeng Account", and the authentication status is safely synchronized through the cloud~


## 5. Future Outlook: The "ultimate form" of distributed authentication

### (I) Quantum Authentication: "Absolute Security" of Trust
- Use quantum key distribution (QKD) to generate shared keys between devices. In theory, it is absolutely safe and not afraid of quantum computing attacks~
- Scenarios: "high-sensitivity scenarios" such as financial transactions, national defense systems, and "zero risk" for trust between equipment~

### (II) Environment perception certification: "Scenario-based evolution" of trust
- Dynamically adjust the authentication strategy based on multi-dimensional data such as geographical location, time, and device status:
- During the day in the company: Automatically trust all office equipment after certification
- At Home at Night: Trust only bound home devices
- In the early morning at a strange location: compulsory secondary authentication to prevent equipment from being stolen ~


## Last chat
The core of distributed authentication is to let the device learn to "transmit trust" and at the same time maintain the "bottom line of security".Hongmeng makes cross-device authentication both convenient and safe through combinations of soft buses, distributed databases, dynamic permissions, etc.Next time, let’s talk about “how to use Hongmeng atomized service to perform “minimal simple authentication”, such as scanning the code to authenticate, no need to download the App – remember to follow!😉
