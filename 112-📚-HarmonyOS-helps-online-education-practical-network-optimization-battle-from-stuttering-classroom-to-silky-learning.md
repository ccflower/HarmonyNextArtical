# 📚 HarmonyOS helps online education: practical network optimization battle from stuttering classroom to silky learning

> As a developer who was stuck in online classes and wanted to smash the computer, today I want to share the practical online education of HarmonyOS network acceleration!After using this solution to optimize, students reported that "live broadcast is as smooth as local playback", and these life-saving techniques must be made public~


## 1. The "Internet Life and Death Line" of Online Education

Last week, when I helped the training institution adjust the online course APP, the teacher complained: "When the key points are mentioned, the picture is stuck and all the students are running away."Online education requires more stringent Internet requirements than social apps:
- **Live broadcast cannot be stuck**: Every 1 second of stuttering, students lose 20% of their attention
- **Courseware loading in seconds**: The time to wait for the courseware for more than 3 seconds, the exit rate soars
- **Data must be secure**: Student privacy and course information cannot be leaked

HarmonyOS's network acceleration service is like installing a "voltage regulator" for online classes. The following is the practical solution~


## 2. Network architecture: build an "exclusive highway" for online courses

### 1. The layered architecture is super stable

| Layer name | Responsibilities | Analogy |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|  
| Application layer | Live broadcast interface and courseware list for students to watch | Classroom blackboard |
| Network service layer | Manage request sending, result processing | Express sorting center |
| Data cache layer | Common courseware storage, emergency rescue when network misses | backup textbooks in the back row of classroom |
| Network adaptation layer | Choose the fastest network, and the network cutting will not be stuck | Traffic commander |

### 2. Module collaboration is like "pipeline"

1. Students click "Open Live" → Application layer to notify the network service layer
2. First check whether there is live stream in the cache layer → if there is no network adapter layer, select the network
3. Select the network (such as 5G) in the network adapter layer → initiate a request from the network service layer
4. When the live stream is returned, the cache layer is stored first → then display it to the application layer.


## 3. Online guarantee for live classes: Teachers’ lectures are not “stuck”

### 1. Adaptive bit rate: automatic "speed bump" mechanism

- **Strong.com**: 2Mbps HD live broadcast, the teacher can read it clearly
- **Weak network**: Automatically reduce to 500kbps standard definition, and priority is to ensure smoothness

```typescript
import { netQuality } from '@kit.NetworkBoostKit';

// Monitor network quality and automatically adjust code rate
netQuality.on('netQosChange', (qos) => {
const bandwidth = qos.linkDownBandwidth; // Unit kbps
  
if (bandwidth < 800) {
setVideoQuality('Standard Definition'); // 500kbps
console.log('Net difference, cut to standard definition mode');
  } else {
setVideoQuality('HD'); // 2000kbps
console.log('The network is good, cut to HD mode');
  }
});

function setVideoQuality(quality) {
  const player = getVideoPlayer();
player.setBitrate(quality === 'Standard Definition' ? 500000: 2000000);
}
```  

### 2. Multi-network switching: Continuous classes from classroom to corridor

- **Switching conditions**: When WiFi signal < -70dBm and 4G bandwidth>500kbps
- **Seamless Continue**: Pre-cache 5 seconds of video before cutting the net, and then play it after cutting.

```typescript
import { netHandover } from '@kit.NetworkBoostKit';

// Save 5 seconds of video before cutting the net
netHandover.on('handoverStart', () => {
preloadVideo(5); // Preload for 5 seconds
console.log('Prepare to cut the net, save 5 seconds of video first');
});

// Continue to broadcast after cutting the network
netHandover.on('handoverComplete', () => {
  resumeFromPreload();
console.log('Successfully cut the net, continue from the preload');
});
```  


## 4. Courseware loading optimization: "Page turns in seconds" like flipping books

### 1. Preloading strategy: "Preview" before students

- **Preload the next class after class**: After class, the second class is automatically preloaded after class
- **Smart Sorting**: Preload difficult courses first, save more caches for popular courses

```typescript
// Pre-load the next get out of class after class
afterClass(() => {
const Next class = getNextCourse();
preloadCourseMaterials(next class.id);
});

function preloadCourseMaterials(courseId) {
const courseware = getCourseMaterials(courseId);
Courseware.forEach((material) => {
    loadInBackground(material.url, {
priority: material.difficulty > 3 ? 'high' : 'medium' // Difficult courses are preferred
    });
  });
}
```  

### 2. Cache management: the "smart bookshelf" of courseware

- **Memory + local two-level cache**: Commonly used courseware to store memory, and infrequently used stored locally
- **Operational clearance**: Courseware that exceeds 7 days will be automatically deleted, saving space

```typescript
// Save the courseware to memory, move the local area when full
function saveToCache(material) {
  if (memoryCache.size < MAX_MEMORY) {
    memoryCache.add(material);
  } else {
const has not been used for the longest time = memoryCache.getLeastUsed();
localCache.add (last time not used);
memoryCache.remove(the longest has not been used);
    memoryCache.add(material);
  }
}

// Clear expired courseware every week
weekly(() => {
  clearExpiredCache();
});
```  


## 5. Safety and stability: "Anti-theft Door" for online courses

### 1. Data encryption: the "password lock" of the courseware

- **Transmission encryption**: Student homework and exam papers are transmitted with AES encryption
- **Local Encryption**: The cached courseware is also encrypted locally to prevent the phone from being stolen

```typescript
// Encrypted jobs are sent again
function submitHomework(homework) {
const encryption job = encrypt(homework, AES_KEY);
sendToServer(encrypted job);
}

// Local courseware encrypted memory
function saveCourseLocally(course) {
const encryption courseware = encrypt(course, LOCAL_KEY);
fs.writeFile('encrypted_course', encryption courseware);
}
```  

### 2. Heartbeat mechanism: the "Electronic Graph" of the Internet

- **Test every 10 seconds**: Automatically reconnect after disconnection, up to 3 trials
- **Smart Retry**: Retry after 1 second the first time, 2 seconds the second time, 4 seconds the third time

```typescript
// A heartbeat once in 10 seconds
setInterval(() => {
  if (isNetworkDown()) {
reconnect(0); // Start reconnecting
  }
}, 10000);

function reconnect(number of retry) {
const interval = 2 **Number of retry; // 1s→2s→4s
const success = netManager.reconnect();
  
if (!Success && Number of retry times < 3) {
    setTimeout(() => {
reconnect(number of retry + 1);
}, interval * 1000);
  }
}
```  


## 6. Practical data: How much difference is before and after optimization?

| Scenario | Before Optimization | After Optimization |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|  
| Live Stuck Rate | 15 times/hour | 2 times/hour |
| Courseware loading time | Average 8 seconds | Average 1.5 seconds |
| Weak network disconnection rate | 30% | 5% |


## The last thought

I remember when I was testing in a mountain school for the first time, the 4G signal was only 2 grids, and the courseware loaded so slowly that the teacher dropped chalk~ After optimization, the teacher said, "Now clicking the courseware is as fast as flipping a book", and asked me if I "opened the back door" for the APP~ In fact, I just used the network acceleration function of HarmonyOS right~
