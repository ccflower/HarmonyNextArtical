Hi~ I am Xiao L!In Hongmeng's distributed world, user authentication is like a "one-card" - after mobile phone authentication, tablets, car machines and other devices can "pass through sensorlessly".Today I will talk about how Hongmeng makes cross-device authentication fast and safe~


## 1. The "two major problems" of distributed authenticationü§Ø
### Scene pain points
1. **The state between devices is not synchronized**
- Example: The phone logs into the smart home app, but the speaker requires a password to be entered again
- Consequences: User experience is split, and even misjudgment of permissions

2. **Cross-device trust risk**
- Example: Hacker forged the identity of device A and tried to obtain user data through device B
- Consequence: Data breach, system attack


## 2. Hongmeng‚Äôs ‚ÄúThree Skills‚Äù solutionüöÄ
### (I) Distributed database: "safe" for authentication information
**Core logic**:
- The device of the same user forms a "certification group" (such as mobile phone + tablet + car machine)
- The authentication status is synchronized to all devices in the group in real time
- Sensitive data (such as fingerprint templates) are stored encrypted and scattered across different devices

**Code Example: Status Synchronization**
```typescript
import distributedDB from '@ohos.distributedDB';

// The user logged in successfully on his mobile phone
async function loginSuccess(userId: string) {
  const group = await distributedDB.getGroup('user_auth_group');
await group.put('auth_status', 'valid'); // Write to authentication status
await group.sync(); // Synchronize to all devices in the group
}

// Check the certification status of the vehicle terminal
async function checkAuth() {
  const group = await distributedDB.getGroup('user_auth_group');
  return group.get('auth_status') === 'valid';
}
```

### (II) Soft bus security channel: "encrypted express delivery" of certified data
**Transfer Process**:
1. ** Device mutual identity verification**: Exchange digital certificates (similar to ID cards)
2. **Dynamic key encryption**: Generate a unique key for each communication to prevent interception
3. **Bi-way verification data**: Sender's signature + receiver's signature verification, tamper-proof

**Critical Code: Secure Communication**
```typescript
import distributedBus from '@ohos.distributedBus';

// Send authentication tokens to the car computer
async function sendTokenToCar(deviceId: string, token: string) {
  const session = await distributedBus.createSession(deviceId);
// Encrypt the token with the device public key
  const encryptedToken = await crypto.encryptWithPublicKey(token, devicePublicKey);
  await session.send(encryptedToken);
  session.close();
}

// The vehicle machine receives and decrypts
async function receiveToken() {
  const session = await distributedBus.acceptSession();
  const encryptedToken = await session.recv();
// Decrypt with private key
  const token = await crypto.decryptWithPrivateKey(encryptedToken, localPrivateKey);
return verifyToken(token); // Verify the validity of the token
}
```

### (III) Group authentication strategy: Flexible "passing rules"
**Tracking Certification Example**:
| Device Type | Authentication Method | Permissions within the Group |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|  
| Mobile phone | Fingerprint + password (strong authentication) | Other devices can be authorized |
| Tablet | Device lock screen password (weak authentication) | Inheriting mobile phone permissions |
| Smart speakers | Voiceprint recognition (medium certification) | Basic operations are allowed only |

**Logical implementation**:
```typescript
// Determine the safety level of the equipment
function getDeviceSecurityLevel(deviceType: string): number {
  switch(deviceType) {
case 'phone': return 3; // The highest level
    case 'tablet': return 2;
    case 'smartSpeaker': return 1;
  }
}

// Dynamically adjust the certification process
async function adaptAuthFlow(deviceId: string) {
  const level = getDeviceSecurityLevel(await getDeviceType(deviceId));
  if (level >= 2 && isGroupAuthenticated()) {
return 'skip'; // Unsecured authentication
  } else {
return 'full'; // Complete certification process
  }
}
```


## 3. Practical scenario: "cross-device office" certification optimizationüíº
### Scene Description
- Users use fingerprint to log in to the enterprise OA system on their mobile phone
- Automatically inherit login status when switching to tablet editing documents
- When using a colleague's computer temporarily, secondary verification is required (such as SMS verification code)

### Key implementation steps
1. **Mobile login**:
- Complete fingerprint + password authentication and generate short-term tokens (valid for 30 minutes)
- Token encrypted storage to distributed database and synchronized to tablet

2. **Tablet Access**:
- Detected that there is a valid token in the local area and release it directly
- Record operation log: `User A edits documents on the tablet at 14:20`

3. **College's computer access**:
- The device is not in the authentication group, triggering secondary verification
- The mobile phone receives a verification code request, and after entering it, it generates a temporary token (valid for 5 minutes)


## 4. "Balance technique" of safety and efficiency ‚ö†Ô∏è
### 1. **Data Minimization Principle**
- No original password is stored, only hash value (salt processing)
- Local encrypted storage of biometric data, not uploaded to the cloud

### 2. **Dynamic risk perception**
- Monitor abnormal login: off-site equipment, high-frequency authentication failed
- Automatically trigger strong authentication: If you require fingerprint verification after 3 consecutive weak authentication failures

### 3. **Privacy Protection Design**
- Users can clear group authentication data at any time
- After the device exits the group, the local authentication information will be automatically deleted


## 5. Future trend: "Insensitivity Evolution" of CertificationüöÄ
1. **Behavior authentication**: Automatically identify users through typing rhythm and gesture habits
2. **Quantum encryption authentication**: Using quantum key distribution technology to achieve absolutely secure authentication communication
3. **Environmental Perception Authentication**: Automatically adjust the authentication strength according to geographical location and device connection relationship


## Summary: The "golden formula" of distributed authenticationüìù
**Certification experience = (Simultaneous speed across devices √ó Security level) √∑ User operation cost**
- Core goal: Let trusted devices "pass through sensorlessly", suspicious devices "verify layer by layer"
- Development points: Prioritize the use of distributed database synchronization status, and make good use of soft bus encryption channels
