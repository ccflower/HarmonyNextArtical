
# Exploration of Hongmeng Next development model: From "building building blocks" to "cross-end collaboration" 🧱

Hi~ I am Xiao L!The development model of Hongmeng Next is like "fitting Lego" - splitting the application into independent modules, and then "assembly" it into a cross-device experience with distributed capabilities.Today, we will show you three key innovation points to unlock new development ideas~


## 1. Modular development: Let the application "plug and play" 🔌
### Core idea
- **Atomic Split**: Split the application into independent modules (such as login modules, payment modules)
- **Loading on demand**: The main module only contains necessary functions, and the secondary module is dynamically downloaded
- **Cross-project reuse**: A module can be called by multiple applications

### Practical Example: Modularization of E-commerce Applications
```  
├── main_module # main module (home page, search)
│   └── src  
├── user_module # User Center module (can be independently tested)
│   ├── src  
└── config.json (declare dependency: network_module)
└── network_module # network request module (general capability)
    └── src  
```

** Advantages**:
- Teams can develop different modules in parallel (such as group A is used as interface, group B is used as network logic)
- Module hot update: Users can get new features without reinstalling the application


## 2. ArkUI declarative development: "What you see is code" 📐
### Core features
- **State Driver Interface**: Use `@State`/`@Link` to mark data, and automatically update the view when changes
- **Responsive layout**: A set of codes is adapted to mobile phone/flat tablet/car screen
- **Componential packaging**: Custom components can be reused (such as general buttons, input boxes)

### Code comparison: Login interface development
#### Traditional imperative (Android)
```java  
Button btn = new Button(this);  
btn.setText("Login");
btn.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {  
    @Override  
    public void onClick(View v) {  
// Logical processing
    }  
});  
```  

#### Hongmeng Declarative (ArkUI)
```typescript  
@Entry  
@Component  
struct Login {  
  @State isLoading: boolean = false;  

  build() {  
Button(isLoading? 'Loading...' : 'Login')
      .onClick(() => this.isLoading = true)  
.loading(isLoading) // Automatically switch loading status
      .width('80%')  
  }  
}  
```  

**Efficiency improvement**:
- 50% reduction in code volume+
- Separate interface logic from business logic, more intuitive debugging


## 3. Distributed development: Let the equipment "team collaboration" 👥
### Core abilities
1. **Cross-device task scheduling**
- Mobile phone initiates tasks, automatic relay of flat panel/car machine
   ```typescript  
   import taskManager from '@ohos.distributedTask';  
taskManager.transferTask(deviceId, 'editDocument'); // Migrate editing tasks to the tablet
   ```  

2. **Equipment capability sharing**
- Calling sensors/camerases for other devices
   ```typescript  
   import deviceAbility from '@ohos.deviceAbility';  
const camera = deviceAbility.acquire('remote:camera:deviceId'); // Use remote camera
   ```  

3. **Distributed Data Storage**
- Real-time synchronization of multi-device data
   ```typescript  
   import distributedData from '@ohos.distributedData';  
distributedData.subscribe('todoList', (data) => { /* Data change callback */ });
   ```  

### Scenario case: Cross-device meeting record
- **Mobile phone**: Start the meeting record application and call the local microphone to record
- **Tablet**: Automatically join collaboration, display text translation in real time (using tablet computing power)
- **Smart Wear**: After the meeting, the watch vibration reminder will be kept.

**Code Key Snippet**:
```typescript  
// The main device (mobile phone) initiates collaboration
distributedTask.startCollaboration([deviceId]);  

// Receive tasks from the device (tablet)
onTaskReceived(task => {  
  if (task.type === 'recordMeeting') {  
startTranscribing(); // Start text translation
  }  
});  
```


## 4. Development efficiency tools: "One-stop" to complete the entire process🚀
### 1. New features of DevEco Studio 4.0
- **Real-time preview**: After modifying the code, the multi-device emulator refreshes the interface synchronously
- **Module dependency analysis**: Visually view module call relationships and quickly locate conflicts
- **Automated Test**: Generate cross-device test cases with one click

### 2. Low-code development platform
- **Applicable scenarios**: Quickly build tool applications (such as attendance check-in, approval process)
- **Operation Example**:
1. Drag and drop component generation interface (list, form)
2. Configure distributed capabilities (such as "click the button → send data to the car machine")
3. Publish to the mobile phone/car application market with one click


## 5. Future trends: "Evolutionary Blueprint" of the development model🚀
1. **AI-assisted development**
- Automatically generate ArkUI interface (upload design draft → automatic code generation)
- Intelligently optimize distributed task allocation (such as dynamic scheduling based on device load)

2. **Zero Code Deployment**
- The module is automatically adapted to all Hongmeng devices after compilation
- Real-time monitoring of application performance in the cloud, automatically triggering hot updates

3. **Atomization Service Development**
- Single module can be published independently as "universal card"
- Cards can be called directly by other applications (such as weather cards embedded in calendar applications)


## Summary: The "Three Rules" of the New Development Model📌
1. **Module priority**: The functions that can be split into modules are absolutely not coupled
2. **Declarative priority**: Use ArkUI to describe "what" rather than "how to do it"
3. **Distributed Priority**: When developing any function, consider "Can it be used across devices?"
