# User Authentication Advanced: "Future Authentication" from biometrics to cross-device linkage

hello!I am Xiao L, the female programmer who "makes trouble" in the Hongmeng certification system~ Last time we talked about the "three-fold security door". Today, let's take a look at the "future technology" certified by Hongmeng user - biometrics, seamless linkage across devices, and even "automatically adapt" according to your habits~ Get ready, we are going to travel to the "certified black technology" site!


## 1. Biometrics: The evolution from "looking at faces" to "reading minds"

### (I) Fingerprint authentication: not just "click"
1. **Living test: "Fake fingerprint"**
Hongmeng‚Äôs fingerprint sensor is like a "detective". It not only looks at fingerprint patterns, but also touches the "body temperature" and measures the "blood flow".
- Principle: The sensor emits infrared rays and determines whether it is a living body based on the reflected light of the skin.Fake silicone fingerprints will not reflect, just pass it directly~
- Scenario: When transferring money on a bank App, even if a hacker gets your fingerprint, it will be discovered on the spot by the live test!

2. **Multiple fingerprint grouping: "label" fingerprint**
Support different fingerprints to correspond to different permissions, such as:
- Left thumb: Normal unlock (only view photo albums)
- Right index finger: payment certification (can be transferred to money, change password)
   ```typescript
// Fingerprint grouping configuration example
fingerprintManager.setGroup('payment', ['fingerprint_002']); // The index finger of the right hand is classified as "payment group"
if (fingerprintManager.verify('payment')) { // Only this set of fingerprints can trigger payment
Perform payment operation ();
   }
   ```

### (II) Facial recognition: 3D modeling + expression killing
1. **3D structured light: build a "three-dimensional face map"**
Use an infrared camera to project 30,000+ laser points and build a "3D model" for your face, which is 100 times more realistic than 2D photos.
- Anti-cheating: Use photos to deceive?The system will say, "This user, why is your face flat?"
- Dark light adaptation: You can also recognize the lights at night, because infrared light does not take "dark magic"~

2. **Expression authentication: Smile and unlock **
Combined with micro-expression verification, such as:
- When unlocking, the system randomly requires "blinking your left eye" and "opening your mouth", but the video recorded by the hacker did not respond like this~
   ```typescript
// Expression authentication logic
const Random expression = ['Blink', 'open mouth', 'shake head'][Math.floor(Math.random()*3)];
if (user makes (random expression)) {
Unlocked successfully ();
   } else {
Tip ('Please make expressions as required~');
   }
   ```


## 2. Distributed authentication: "Trust Transfer" magic between devices

### (I) Multiple equipment "certification relay"
1. **Mobile phone certification, watch "win"**
After you unlock with your phone's fingerprint, the watch will automatically synchronize the authentication status and no longer need to enter the password.
- Principle: The mobile phone and the watch "secret communication" through the soft bus, and the mobile phone said, "This is my master, let it go!"
- Scene: Get up in the morning, after the phone is unlocked, the watch will automatically turn on health data, and you don‚Äôt have to do it all the time~

2. ** "One-ticket pass" across devices**
In office scenes, after the computer is logged in, the printer and projector will automatically trust you without repeated authentication.
   ```plaintext
// Distributed authentication process
Computer authentication is successful ‚Üí Report "User logged in" to the certification center
Printer Query Certification Center ‚Üí Discover the user is logged in ‚Üí Allow printing
// Hackers want to use the printer?Sorry, go to the computer to authenticate first!
   ```

### (II) Seamless switching: Scene triggers "automatic authentication"
1. **Close to unlock: When the person arrives in front of the door, the lock will automatically open**
The phone is equipped with the "Bluetooth Key". When you walk to the door, the door lock detects the phone's Bluetooth signal and automatically triggers authentication.
- Anti-missive touch: It must also meet "Bluetooth signal strength + phone unlocked" to prevent you from accidentally opening when passing by your neighbor's door~

2. **Driving scenario: Bracelet certification, starting the car**
Wear a bracelet and approach the car. The bracelet vibrates and prompts "whether to unlock". After touching to confirm, the car starts and you don't have to take out your phone throughout the journey~
   ```typescript
// Car authentication logic
   carSensor.on('user_nearby', async () => {
const authentication result = await wristband.verify('unlock_car'); // Bracelet verification identity
if (authentication result) {
car.start(); // Start the car
       }
   });
   ```


## 3. Personalized certification: "Certification Manager" who understands you better than you

### (I) Dynamic permissions: Your habits determine the intensity of authentication
1. **Commonly used equipment "free for password access"**
Commonly used devices such as tablets and watches at home will be automatically added to the "trust list" after authentication. Skip the fingerprint when logging in next time and enter the system directly~
- Security guarantee: After more than 7 days, the trust will be automatically cancelled to prevent the device from being abused after it is lost ~

2. **Sensitive operation "temporary increase"**
When you want to change your password and transfer a lot of money, the system suddenly "gets stricter":
- Use fingerprints normally, add dynamic tokens at this time
- Principle: Analyze your operational risks through machine learning, and sensitive behaviors trigger "secondary security check" ~
   ```typescript
// Risk identification example
const risk level = riskAnalyzer.analyze (operation type, equipment location);
if (Risk Level > Medium) {
requireMultiFactorAuth(); // Forced multi-factor authentication
   }
   ```

### (II) Interface customization: You have the final say on your certification interface
1. **Corporate customization: Logo+exclusive color matching**
Enterprise applications can change the certification interface to the company logo and main color, such as bank apps using blue, technology companies using silver gray~
   ```xml
<!-- Custom authentication interface style -->
   <AuthenticationLayout>
       <Image src="$media:company_logo" width="200" height="200"/>
<Text style="color: #007DFF; font-size: 24">Welcome to log in to the XX enterprise system</Text>
       <FingerprintButton position="bottom"/>
   </AuthenticationLayout>
   ```

2. **User customization: component "drag and pull"**
Individual users can adjust the order of authentication components, such as putting the "fingerprint" on the left and the "password" on the right, which is in line with your operating habits~


## 4. Practical cases: When the certification system "accompanies the customs"

### (I) Financial scenario: "Three-fold insurance" prevents money laundering
A bank App custom certification plan:
1. **Login phase**: Fingerprint + face (3D structured light)
2. **Transfer Phase**: Dynamic Token (SMS + Hardware Token Choose One)
3. **Large transfer**: Manual review (the system automatically calls the reserved phone number and voice confirmation)
*Effect*: After going online, the loss of funds caused by phishing attacks decreased by 92%~

### (II) Industrial scenarios: "Anti-interference" certification scheme
The equipment control system of a certain factory has a noisy environment and workers wear gloves. The traditional certification is not good~
- Use "Iris Recognition + Gesture Action" instead:
- Scan the iris in the camera of the hard hat
- Do a "wave" action at the same time (prevent mistaken touch)
- Trust transfer between equipment: once certified, all equipment in the factory is free of passwords within 2 hours
*Effect*: Workers' operating efficiency is increased by 40%, and the error operation rate is reduced to 0~


## 5. Future brains: The "ultimate form" of the certification system

### (I) Brain-computer interface authentication: Once the thought moves, it will automatically unlock
Imagine: when wearing a brain head ring and trying to unlock the phone, the brain will have the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"unlocking" and the system will recognize it~
- Principle: Identify specific thinking patterns through EEG brain waves
- Safety point: Everyone's brain wave pattern is unique and harder to copy than fingerprints~

### (II) Environment perception authentication: Your location is the password
Automatic authentication based on your daily track, such as:
- Arrive at the company at 8 o'clock every day, and the mobile phone will be automatically unlocked (GPS+Wi-Fi MAC address verification)
- When traveling to another place, a dynamic token is mandatory when logging in suddenly (the location exception triggers)
- Anti-cheating: Combining the step number sensor, confirm that you are really in the company, not using virtual positioning~
