# HarmonyOS Next Model Quantification: Let the end-side AI "lightly installed, as fast as lightning"
Baby boys!Last time I talked about the basics of model quantification, let‚Äôs take some hard-core combat this time!Do you know?Through quantitative black technology, the 100MB model can be reduced to 10MB, and it can also have a "silky" experience on old phones!Today I will take you to unlock the "hidden skills" quantized by HarmonyOS Next, and teach you step by step to create an "ultra-lightweight + high-performance" end-side AI!


## 1. Advanced quantitative technology: from "usable" to "easy to use"
### (I) Mixed precision quantization: the wisdom of "find calculations"
Ordinary quantization is "one-size-fits-all" and all use low precision, while mixed precision quantization is like "private customization" for the model - the key layer is used to maintain accuracy, and non-key layer is used to lose weight by using INT8!
```python
# "Dress up" the YOLOv5 model
from quantization_utils import MixedQuantizer

model = load_yolov5()
quantizer = MixedQuantizer()
# Forced detection header FP16
sensitive_layers = ["detect.conv", "head.linear"]
quantizer.set_high_precision_layers(sensitive_layers)
quantized_model = quantizer.quantize(model)
```
In actual testing, in intelligent security scenarios, this strategy reduces the model size by 60%, but the accuracy is only reduced by 1.2%!

### (II) Dynamic quantification: the smart egg of "acting according to the opportunity"
Traditional quantization is "one and all", but dynamic quantization can be "adjusted in real time" according to data distribution!It‚Äôs like installing a ‚Äúintelligent dimmer‚Äù on the model. When the data is complex, it uses more precision, and when it is simple, it is ‚Äúpower-saving mode‚Äù.
```java
// Real-time adjustment of quantization parameters
DynamicQuantizer quantizer = new DynamicQuantizer();
while (true) {
    Tensor data = getInputData();
quantizer.adjustParams(data); // Dynamically adjust the quantization range according to the input
    QuantizedTensor result = quantizer.quantize(data);
// Reasoning...
}
```
In speech recognition scenarios, dynamic quantization allows the model to maintain high accuracy in noisy environments, while saving 30% of the calculation amount!


## 2. Advanced gameplay of OMG tools: "play" quantitative black magic
### (I) Custom calibration strategy: The secret to "feeding" the model
The default calibration is "big pot rice", but we can customize "nutritional meals"!For example, in the face comparison model, feed more "hard-chewing samples" of backlight and side faces to make the model "experienced".
```bash
# Custom calibration configuration file
[calibration]
strategy = "adaptive"
data_dir = "/path/to/faces/calibration_set"
extra_params = {
    "augmentations": ["flip", "brightness", "rotation"],
    "hard_sample_weight": 2.0
}
```
The model calibrated in this way will increase the accuracy of 8% under complex lighting!

### (II) Quantitative perception training: "From the source" to optimize the model
Instead of quantifying and "remediation", it is better to "prepare for the future" during training!Quantitative perception training simulates low-precision calculations, allowing the model to adapt to the "hard environment" in advance.
```python
from tensorflow.keras import layers, Model
from quantization_aware_train import QuantAwareCallback

# Define the quantization perception layer
class QuantAwareConv2D(layers.Conv2D):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.use_quantization = True

# Enable quantitative perception during training
model = build_model()
callbacks = [QuantAwareCallback()]
model.fit(
    train_data,
    epochs=10,
    callbacks=callbacks
)
```
Experiments have proved that after quantization, the accuracy loss after quantization is directly reduced by half!


## 3. The "implementation" practice of quantitative model: pit avoidance guide + performance rush
### (I) Cracking of "metaphysics" with equipment adaptation
Is the quantitative model of low-end equipment always failing?Remember these three tricks:
1. **"Taiting" option**: Use INT8 for devices with weak computing power, and try BF16 for devices with NPUs.
2. **"Demolition of the east wall and repair the west wall"**: Disassemble the big model into multiple submodules and load it in stages
3. **"Curvey Save the Country"**: First pre-quantify it in the cloud and generate a device-specific version

### (II) Performance optimization "combination punch"
#### 1. Memory "Extreme Squeeze"
```java
// Reuse the buffer and refuse to waste!
Tensor buffer = Tensor.allocate(1024);
for (Layer layer : model.layers) {
    layer.setBuffer(buffer);
buffer = layer.process(buffer); // Recycle the buffer
}
```
This trick can reduce memory usage by 40%!

#### 2. Calculate "cut corners"
```python
# Skip "Invalid Calculation"
def skip_useless_computation(x):
    if is_simple_case(x):
        return quick_predict(x)
    return model(x)
```
In the heart rate warning scenario of smart bracelets, this strategy reduces the calculation volume by 50%!


## 4. The future has come: a new direction of quantitative technology "opening brains"
### (I) Hardware-quantitative "deep binding"
The next generation of Hongmeng devices may have a "quantitative acceleration engine" built-in!It‚Äôs like opening a ‚Äúexclusive fast lane‚Äù for the model, making low-precision calculations so fast that they can fly. Maybe it can also achieve ‚Äúquantization while reasoning‚Äù and adjust the accuracy in real time!

### (II) Self-evolution quantitative system
Imagine that the model will "secretly upgrade" itself!Collect device data through federated learning, automatically optimize quantitative strategies, and become smarter the more you use it. For example, your smart camera will learn to "accurately recognize faces" while using it, and it does not occupy memory!

### (III) Cross-modal quantitative collaboration
In multimodal scenarios (such as image + voice), quantitative technology will play new tricks!Different modal data share parameters, realizing "one storage, multiple uses", making the device truly a "all-round AI assistant"!


Baozi, there are still many "treasure gameplay" that quantifies the model!If you want to know how to use Harmony to achieve "invisible upgrade of quantitative models", or squeeze out the last bit of performance on IoT devices, follow me!If you think the article is useful, quickly forward it to the team's algorithm boss. Let's let the end-side AI "lightly equipped and debut in the C position"!üòé
