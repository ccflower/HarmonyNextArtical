# ðŸ›’ Hongmeng Distributed Mall Development Streamline Guide: Core Architecture and Practical Points

## 1. Overview of the project core architecture
**1. Distributed Scenario Positioning**
- Multi-device collaboration: mobile phone (interactive core), tablet (large screen display), watch (fast operation)
- Core requirements: real-time shopping cart synchronization, cross-device settlement, multi-terminal state maintenance

**2. Four-layer architecture design**
```  
Front-end display layer (UI for each device) â†’ Business logic layer (distributed services) â†’ Data storage layer (distributed database) â†’ Device management layer (task scheduling + security)
```  

**3. Service Splitting Principle**
- Products and services (display/search), shopping cart services (cross-device synchronization), payment services (safety priority)


## 2. Distributed data synchronization core
**1. Key points of data model**
- Shopping cart model contains fields such as user ID, product list, total price, update time, etc.
- Use `DistributedData` to achieve real-time cross-device synchronization

**2. Synchronization Policy**
- Combination of local cache + distributed storage, update locally first and then synchronize remotely
- Subscribe to data change events and refresh the UI of each device in real time


## 3. Cross-device task scheduling
**1. Task allocation principle**
- Calculate tasks to tablets/mobile phones, pay tasks to mobile phones (safety)
- Intelligent scheduling based on device type (`tablet`/`phone`/`wearable`)

**2. Core Process**
1. Watch start settlement â†’ 2. Tablet calculate total price â†’ 3. Mobile phone start payment â†’ 4. All devices synchronize order status


## 4. Key points of multi-device UI adaptation
**1. Responsive Design**
- Grid layout for tablets, and list layout for mobile phones/watches
- Detect device type through tool functions such as `isTabletDevice()`

**2. Component adaptation example**
- Shopping cart list: double-row display on tablets, simplified into single-row cards


## 5. Distributed payment process
**1. Security-first policy**
- Payment tasks are forcibly distributed to mobile phone devices to avoid sensitive operations such as watches and other low-security devices
- Payment password encrypted storage, combining device ID and user ID to generate encryption keys

**2. Cross-device process**
- Watch click to settle â†’ Mobile phone receive tasks to adjust payment SDK â†’ All devices synchronize order status


## 6. Safety and performance optimization
**1. Core security measures**
- Sensitive data encryption storage (`EncryptedStorage`)
- Dynamic permission application (key permissions such as payment/storage)

**2. Performance optimization results**
| Optimization | Improvement |
|--------------|------------|  
| Startup Time | 46.7% |
| Cart Loading | 61.1% |
| Cross-device synchronization | 75% |


## 7. Practical Golden Rules
1. **Data first**: Design a distributed data model first, and then develop functions
2. ** Device adaptation**: Start designing from a small screen (watch) and then expanding to a large screen
3. **Task Diversion**: Assign tasks according to device capabilities to avoid centralized calls

**Tip avoidance tips**:
- Avoid overdistributed, and local processing is preferred for simple functions
- All cross-device calls must include a retry mechanism
