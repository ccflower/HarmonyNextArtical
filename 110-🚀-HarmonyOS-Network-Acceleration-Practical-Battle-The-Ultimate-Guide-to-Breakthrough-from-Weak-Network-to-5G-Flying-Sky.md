# üöÄ HarmonyOS Network Acceleration Practical Battle: The Ultimate Guide to Breakthrough from Weak Network to 5G Flying Sky

> As a developer who uses APP to stuck in the basement to doubt his life, today I will use my big move!After using HarmonyOS network acceleration service optimization, the customer said, "Watching videos in the elevator is like teleportation." These practical skills to make the network take off quickly are released today~


## 1. Complex network: Install "intelligent navigation" for the application

### 1. Multi-network migration: "Seamless lane change" on the expressway

Last week, I tested the APP at the high-speed rail station. The video did not stop when WiFi was 4G, and it all depends on this trick:
- **Intelligent lane change timing**: Automatically cut 4G when WiFi signal < -70dBm
- **Breakpoint continues**: Remember the download progress when changing the network, like driving, remember where to drive

```typescript
import { netHandover } from '@kit.NetworkBoostKit';

// Listen to the notification of network change, such as navigation reminder "change lanes ahead"
netHandover.on('handoverChange', (info) => {
  if (info.handoverStart) {
console.log('Prepare to change the network, remember the progress first');
    saveDownloadProgress();
  } else if (info.handoverComplete) {
console.log('The network change was successful, continue from the last location');
    resumeDownloadFromProgress();
  }
});
```  

### 2. Weak network optimization: "speed bump strategy" in the tunnel

The secret of video reading in the underground garage:
- **Data compression**: Like packing your luggage, the original 10MB video is pressed to 5MB
- **Adaptive speed regulation**: Automatically reduce video from 1080P to 240P when the network is poor

```typescript
import { netQuality } from '@kit.NetworkBoostKit';

// When the network is different, it will automatically switch to "power saving mode"
netQuality.on('netQosChange', (qos) => {
if (qos.linkDownBandwidth < 500) { // Downlink bandwidth < 500kbps is considered weak network
console.log('Enter the weak network, the video cuts to 240P');
    switchVideoQuality('240p');
enableDataCompression(); // Turn on data compression
  } else {
console.log('Start take off quickly, switch back to 1080P');
    switchVideoQuality('1080p');
    disableDataCompression();
  }
});
```  


## 2. Custom acceleration: Apply "exclusive turbocharger"

### 1. Personalized strategy: "Driving mode" of different APPs

| Application Type | Weak Net Strategy | Effect |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|  
| Video conference | Priority for audio protection and video frame rate reduction | Subway conferences will not be stuck in PPT |
| Financial APP | Encrypted transmission + 3 reconnections | Transfer success rate + 90% |
| Mobile Games | Predicting weak network caches operation instructions first | Team battles do not delay playback skills |

### 2. System collaboration: "Open navigation" for the network

Last time I started a live APP, I discovered this secret:
1. The live broadcast was stuttered, and the call to reportQoe tells the system that it is blocked here.
2. After the system receives it, the next time the live broadcast will be "opened green channel" in similar scenarios.

```typescript
// "Complaint" to the system when the live broadcast is stuck
const liveQoe = {
  serviceType: 'liveBroadcast',
  qoeType: 'buffering'
};
netQuality.reportQoe(liveQoe).then(() => {
console.log('I have told the system that the live broadcast card is waiting for optimization~');
});
```  


## 3. Practical Optimization: My "Resurrection of the Internet" secret

### 1. Three Golden Rules

#### üè∑Ô∏è Preload + cache: stock up before entering the elevator
- Scenario: Preload 10 messages before entering the subway, and check the cache first when there is no network
- Code Tips:
```typescript
if (predictWeakNet()) {
preloadNext10Messages(); // Predict the weak network and load the message first
}
```  

#### üß© Dynamic sharding: Split large files into "small express delivery"
- Scene: When 1GB of video is transmitted, it will be disassembled into 1MB small pieces, and only the last piece will be retransmitted after the network is cut off.
- Code Core:
```typescript
const chunks = splitFileIntoChunks(file, 1024*1024); // 1MB per piece
sendChunksWithRetry(chunks);
```  

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Intelligent downgrade: "Abandon the car and keep the handsome" when the network is in trouble
- Scene: When the video conference network is not bad, the camera will be turned off automatically to ensure voice
- Policy code:
```typescript
if (isWeakNet()) {
  turnOffCamera();
  prioritizeAudio();
}
```  

### 2. Data comparison: How much difference is before and after the acceleration is turned on?

| Scene | Unstopped acceleration | After starting acceleration |
|--------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|  
| Video brushing in underground garage | Buffer 5 times, 15 seconds each | Buffer only 1 time, 3 seconds to solve |
| High-speed rail document transmission | Failure rate 40% | Failure rate 2% |
| Video conference in elevator | Screen card into PPT | Smooth voice, video quality reduction but not stuck |


## 4. Future Outlook: "Flying Mode" for Network Acceleration

### 1. AI prediction: Know "where to block" before you
- In the future, the system can learn your Internet habits, such as optimizing the network for you in advance when commuting to the subway at 8 o'clock every day

### 2. 6G fusion: The network speed is as fast as "unseen load bar"
- After 6G is commercially available, HarmonyOS may achieve a "zero buffering" experience, wherever you drag and drop the video


## The last thought

When I used the optimized APP in the elevator for the first time, my colleague thought I had secretly changed to the 5G package~ Now my router is broken and I use hot spots, so I can't panic when I am on the acceleration to swipe 4K videos~
