# Huawei Hongmeng Security Engine Upgrade: "Practical Advancement of Offense and Defense" for Enterprise IoT Data Protection
Hi!I am Xiao L, the female programmer who always "fights" in Hongmeng security field~ Do you know?Now the Internet of Things is performing "cat and mouse games" every day, and ransomware and data stealing are like lurking "hacker ghosts"!Don’t panic. HarmonyOS Next has brought a super combination of "dynamic defense + intelligent response" this time. Today, I will reveal these hardcore technologies that can make hackers "crazy"!

## 1. New security threats and response strategies
### (1) Zero-day vulnerability attack protection
Imagine a hacker holding a "invisible key" (zero-day vulnerability) in his hand, and trying to sneak into the system to destroy it while you are unprepared!An industrial Internet of Things platform had fallen apart before, and the loopholes that were not found in the Bluetooth protocol almost made the entire production line "paralyzed".

Hongmeng directly took out the "ultimate shield" - **Dynamic Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**!It is like a super security guard who does not blink for 24 hours, staring at the key processes in the system.Once you find that something is wrong with memory access, start "sandbox isolation" immediately!The suspicious process was locked into a "small black room" so that the attack could not spread at all.
```typescript
import { tee } from '@ohos.security.tee';

// Install a "surveillance camera" for key processes
tee.monitorProcess(['iot_service', 'data_transfer'], (process, status) => {
    if (status === tee.ProcessStatus.ANOMALY) {
tee.isolateProcess(process); // An exception was found?Quarantine now!
    }
});
```

### (II) Supply chain attack prevention
Now hackers are so cunning, and they are burying "thunder" from the source of equipment production!For example, implanting malicious code into sensor firmware and connecting the device to the Internet becomes the "internal response" of hackers.

Hongmeng takes out the "three tricks":
1. **Hardware root trust**: Each device is bound to a unique digital ID card from the factory, just like the "DNA" of the device. Forged devices cannot enter the system at all!
2. **Supply Chain Whitelist**: Only strictly certified chip and firmware suppliers can "get on the car" and eliminate "fakes" from the source.
3. **Full-link traceability**: Every step of data is recorded in detail from the equipment to the platform, and if something happens, you will "find out the mastermind" in minutes!

## 2. Offensive and defensive practical combat: cracking the real security crisis
### Case: The "speed of life and death" of intelligent warehousing systems
In the smart warehouse of an e-commerce giant, a large amount of temperature and humidity sensor data suddenly jumped wildly, and the temperature display in the refrigeration area soared abnormally!This seems to be a device failure, but in fact it is a data poisoning attack initiated by hackers - tampering with sensor data, attempting to destroy the fresh goods in the entire warehouse!

#### The entire process of Hongmeng emergency response
1. **Exception perception**: The AI ​​algorithm analyzes the data flow in real time and discovers the temperature data "sudden changes in style", triggering an alarm within 3 seconds!
2. **Dynamic Isolation**: Immediately cut off the network connection of the problem sensor to prevent malicious data from continuing to "contaminate" the system.
3. **Data Repair**: Call historical trusted data, combine peripheral sensor information, and restore the real temperature through machine learning algorithms.
4. **Tracking and Counterattack**: The audit system quickly locates the source of the attack, locks in the hacker IP, and directly "counterattack"!

In the end, the warehouse losses were almost zero, and the hacker was caught by the police following the clues!This wave of operations can be regarded as a "textbook-level" case of Internet of Things security!

## 3. Security architecture upgrade: from passive defense to active attack
### (I) AI-driven threat prediction
Hongmeng introduced the **threat intelligence AI brain, which is like a "security prophet"!By analyzing global hacker attack trends and dark web transaction information, predict possible attack methods in advance.For example, if you find that the "phishing email" invasion of ransomware has been popular recently, you will automatically send an early warning to the company to remind you to strengthen the protection of the email gateway.

### (II) Blockchain evidence storage system
Once the data is on the chain, it is like being engraved on a "digital stone tablet"!The operation logs and data modification records of each device are encrypted and stored in the blockchain.Even if a hacker tampers with the database, he cannot erase the "iron evidence" on the blockchain, and he can be invincible even if he sues!

```typescript
import { blockchain } from '@ohos.security.blockchain';

// Upload device operation log to blockchain
const logData = {
    deviceId: 'iot_device_001',
    operation: 'data_update',
    timestamp: Date.now()
};
blockchain.addRecord(logData).then(() => {
console.log('The evidence is successful, the hacker can't deny it!');
});
```

## 4. Developers must read: The "Golden Rules" of Secure Development
### (I) The principle of minimum authority
Don't give "super permissions" to the application!It’s like giving employees a key. If you can use the warehouse door key, don’t give the safe key.
```typescript
// Error demonstration:
requestPermissions(['ohos.permission.ALL']); 

// Correct posture:
if (isDataEncryptionNeeded) {
    requestPermissions(['ohos.permission.CRYPTO']);
}
```

### (II) Code security detection
Using the **CodeGuard tool provided by Hongmeng can uncover the security risks in the code like a "woodpecker"!For example, if you detect a hard-coded password, immediately mark a red warning, which is 10 times faster than if you check it yourself!

## Future Outlook: Safety as Service
In the future, Hongmeng Security will evolve into a "cloud security manager"!Enterprises do not have to build complex security teams themselves. As long as they access Hongmeng Security Cloud Service, they can enjoy real-time vulnerability scanning, threat intelligence sharing, and emergency response support, truly realizing "lying flat" security protection!
