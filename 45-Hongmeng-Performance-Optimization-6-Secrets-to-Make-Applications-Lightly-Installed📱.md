Hello everyone~ I am Xiao L, the female programmer who fought with "Scratch" in Hongmeng Development!Performance optimization is like "weight loss fitness" for the application - deleting redundant code and optimizing resource management, so that the application runs fast and steadily.Today I share 6 practical skills to help your application easily "dump out fat" ~


## 1. Understand first: Where does the performance problems come from?üö¶
### Four "culprits"
1. **Resource waste**
- Example: Components are created repeatedly while list slides, and memory accumulates like "traffic jams"
- Consequences: frequent garbage collection and interface stutter

2. **Code inefficient**
- Example: Use violent search to find data, like turning books page by page in the library
- Consequence: The CPU is so busy that it is "smoking", and the operation delay is obvious

3. **The Internet is dragging the back**
- Example: Every refresh requests full data, and traffic is wasted like "flow"
- Consequence: The interface "fake death" in a weak network environment

4. **The equipment "failure to adapt to the local environment"**
- Example: High-definition resources only available for flagship phones with a thousand yuan machine
- Consequence: Low-configuration equipment goes on strike directly


## 2. Optimization skills: "Make SPA" for the applicationüíÜ
### (I) Memory management: Leave it aside!
- **Object multiplexing**: List components use `cacheStrategy: CacheStrategy.Partial` to cache multiplexing items
  ```typescript
List({ itemHeight: 80, cacheStrategy: 'partial' }) // Only cache items near visible areas
  ```  
- **Release in time**: Clean up listening and temporary objects in `onDestroy`
  ```typescript
  onDestroy() {  
this.timer && clearInterval(this.timer); // Stop the timer
this.imageLoader.cancel(); // Cancel unfinished image loading
  }  
  ```  

### (2) Code optimization: Do "subtraction"!
- **Reject blocking**: Asynchronous use of network requests/file read and writes, don't let the main thread "queu"
  ```typescript
// Error demonstration: Synchronous loading data blocking interface
  // const data = await this.fetchData();  

// Correct demonstration: Use child threads to process
  Thread.start(() => {  
    const data = this.fetchData();  
EventHub.publish('data-loaded', data); // Notify the main thread after completion
  });  
  ```  
- **Algorithm upgrade**: If you can use binary search, don‚Äôt traverse it. If you can use hash tables, don‚Äôt use arrays.

### (III) Network request: Be smarter!
- **Merge request**: Merge multiple small requests into one, reducing "round-trip errands"
  ```typescript
// Merge user information and order requests
  fetch('/api/user/123?with=orders&limit=5');  
  ```  
- **Data Cache**: Use `LocalStorage` to save high-frequency data, such as user configuration
  ```typescript
// Read the cache and request the network if it fails
  const cache = LocalStorage.get('user-profile');  
  if (cache) return cache;  
  const data = await fetch('/api/user');  
  LocalStorage.set('user-profile', data);  
  ```  

### (IV) Graphic rendering: Don‚Äôt "over-dress up"!
- **Avoid hierarchical nesting**: If you can use a single-layer `Stack`, don't use a three-layer `Column`
- **Picture compression**: Load the appropriate size according to the device resolution, don't watch "giant screen movie" on your phone
  ```typescript
// Determine the device type to load different pictures
  const imageUrl = DeviceType.isPhone() ? 'img-sm.jpg' : 'img-lg.jpg';  
  ```  

### (V) Equipment adaptation: "Teach according to your aptitude"!
- **Exclusive solution for low-end equipment**:
- Close complex animation: `if (isLowEndDevice) animation = null;`
- Reduce image quality: compress pixels with `ImagePixelMap`

### (VI) Tool assistance: Let optimization "visualization" üîç
- **DevEco Studio Performance Analysis**:
- Use "Profiler" to view CPU occupation and find out the "high energy consumption" function
- Use "Memory" to monitor memory fluctuations and find leak points
- **System Tools**:
- "Frame Rate Display" is turned on in the developer options, and it should be optimized if it is below 40fps


## 3. Practical cases: Picture application "Slimming Record" üì∑
### Before optimization: "False Fat" symptoms
- When loading 100 pictures, the memory soared to 500MB, and the sliding is obviously stuttering
- CPU occupies more than 60%, and the phone is as hot as a "hand warmer"

### Optimization solution:
1. **Cache + Compression**:
- Save 20 most recent views with `LruCache`
- Compress pictures by screen size, and the resolution is reduced from 2K to 1080P
2. **Async loading**:
- Use thread pool to download concurrently, the main thread is only responsible for rendering
- First display the blurred preview image, "sharpen" after loading

### Optimized: "Lightweight" effect
- Memory drops to 300MB, sliding smoothly
- CPU usage is stable at 25%, the phone "calm"


## Finally draw the key points!üìå
- **If the resources can be reused, don't create new ones. If the objects can be recycled, don't keep them.
- **If the code can be asynchronous, don't block**, if the network can be cached, don't force it
- **If the equipment can be adapted, don‚Äôt make a one-size-fits-all approach**, don‚Äôt guess if the tools can be monitored.
