# Teach you step by step to create a "science fiction" smart home system using HarmonyOS Next

Family!I am Xiao L. I recently developed a super cool HarmonyOS Next smart home system. When I go home from get off work, I can turn on the lights and air conditioners when I move my mouth, which is like living in a science fiction movie!Today I will dig the development process clearly and share a few stories about how to make a mistake~

## Chapter 1: Project Requirements: Let your home understand your "code"
### 1. Functional requirements: a must-have three-piece set for lazy people
1. **The device automatically "recognizes relatives"**
When the newly purchased smart light is plugged into the socket, the system is like a radar installed, and it will pop up automatically: "A new member was detected! Do you want to pull it into the family group?" Whether it is Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or ZigBee devices, they can all "translate" their "dialects".Just like a foreign relative comes to your home, the system comes with simultaneous interpretation~
2. **Silky remote control**
Lying on the sofa, clicking the phone, the lights become an atmosphere group in seconds, the camera screen is seamlessly switched, and even the door lock can be unlocked remotely by scanning the face.If the delay exceeds 1 second, the experience will be like playing 460 games - so real-time must be full!
3. ** Equipment "Health Monitoring"**
Forgot to turn off the lights when you go out?The mobile phone pops up immediately, "The living room light is still fishing!"; the socket secretly runs out of electricity, and the system immediately turns into an electricity bill manager: "Your socket is stealing electricity, hurry up and manage it!" It's more considerate than my mother checking the post~

### 2. System architecture: the "command center" of smart home
1. ** Equipment layer: hard-working "workers"**
Smart lights and cameras are like workers, one is responsible for glowing and the other is responsible for stalking.They package the collected data and send it to their superiors through their respective "couriers" (communication protocol).
2. **Connection layer: universal "translator"**
The distributed soft bus is a super awesome translator. Whether the device speaks Wi-Fi or ZigBee, it can be converted into unified "Mandarin" to make the device and the system chat without barriers.
3. **Business logic layer: the "master" who is planning **
This floor is like a family butler. When you receive the "light turn on" instruction, check your permission first: "This user, do you have the permission to operate the living room light?" After confirming, you will pass the instructions to the device. It is a complete "social terror savior".
4. **UI layer: the "front desk" with good looks**
The interface built by ArkUI must be beautiful and easy to operate!Design a rainbow palette for the lights, and the camera window comes with a beauty filter (no), which makes users unable to help but go crazy~

## Chapter 2: Key Techniques: "Magic Spell" in the Code
### 1. Equipment connection: Let the device actively "post"
1. **Equipment "Family Searching Site"**
```typescript
import deviceManager from '@ohos.distributedHardware.deviceManager';

async function find device() {
    try {
await deviceManager.createDeviceManager('My Smart Home');
deviceManager.on('deviceFound', (device) => {
console.log('Catch one:', device.deviceId);
// You can initiate a "add friends" request here
        });
        deviceManager.startDeviceDiscovery();
    } catch (error) {
console.error('Failed to find the device:', error.message);
    }
}
```
This code is like saying "Newcomer registration" in the family group. Once the new device is launched, it will be automatically @, and it mainly features a "second reply"~

2. **Data "Express Service"**
```typescript
import deviceManager from '@ohos.distributedHardware.deviceManager';

async function sends command (device ID: string, command: string) {
    try {
const target device = await deviceManager.getDevice(device ID);
if (target device) {
const courier = await target device.createDeviceProxy();
const result = await courier.sendMessage(instruction);
console.log('Quick delivery has been delivered, result:', result);
        } else {
console.log('Check no device!');
        }
    } catch (error) {
console.error('The courier lost the item:', error.message);
    }
}
```
Sending instructions to the device is like calling flash delivery, and you can also check the delivery progress in real time, which is more reliable than the delivery guy!

### 2. UI development: The interface must also be "rolled up"
1. **Smart Light "Transformer"**
```typescript
import { Button, Text, Slider } from '@ohos.arkui';

@Component
struct smart light control {
@State Is the light on: boolean = false;
@State Brightness value: number = 50;

  build() {
    Column() {
Text('Smart Light Magic Console')
     .fontSize(20)
     .fontWeight(FontWeight.Bold)
     .margin({ top: 20 });
Button(Is the light on? 'Off light!' : 'Off light!')
     .onClick(() => {
Is the light on? =! Is the light on?
// Secretly send a switch command
        })
     .width('50%')
     .margin({ top: 20 });
Slider({ value: brightness value, min: 0, max: 100 })
.onChange((value) => {
Brightness value = value;
// Send "small note" to adjust the brightness
        })
     .width('80%')
     .margin({ top: 20 });
    }
 .width('100%')
 .height('100%')
 .justifyContent(FlexAlign.Center)
 .alignItems(FlexAlign.Center);
  }
}
```
This interface makes the lighting adjustment like playing a game. Once the slider is pulled, the room will instantly become a disco or candlelight dinner scene~

2. **Interactive Easter Egg**
When clicking the switch button, the button suddenly turns red with a "shy"; when adjusting the brightness, the light gradually changes like a rainbow - these small details directly pull the experience to the ceiling!Just like opening a blind box, there are small surprises every time you operate ~

### 3. Security protection: put on a "bodyproof vest" on the data
1. **Permission "Guardian"**
Write a permission list in the configuration file:
```xml
<manifest xmlns:ohos="http://schemas.huawei.com/res/ohosmanifest"
    package="com.example.smarthome">
    <uses-permission ohos:name="ohos.permission.CAMERA" />
    <uses-permission ohos:name="ohos.permission.DISTRIBUTED_DEVICE_CONTROL" />
  ...
</manifest>
```
During installation, the system will automatically pop up a dialog box: "This app wants to peek at the camera, do you give it permission?" It is stricter than checking your ID card!

2. **Data "encrypted agent"**
```typescript
import crypto from '@ohos.crypto';

async function encryption command (instruction: string): Promise<string> {
    try {
const key = 'top secret code 123'; // In fact, you have to use a serious key!
const encryptor = crypto.createCipher('AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding', key);
const encrypted fragment = encryptor.update(instruction);
const ciphertext = Buffer.concat([encrypted fragment, encryptor.final()]).toString('base64');
return ciphertext;
    } catch (error) {
console.error('encryption overturns:', error.message);
        return '';
    }
}
```
Before data transmission, put on the "invisible cloak" first. Hackers can only see garbled codes after intercepting them, which is even more difficult to decipher than ancient secret letters!

## Chapter 3: Test Optimization: From "Can Use" to "Feng Shen"
### 1. Test the battle
1. **Functional Test: Picking the Bones in Eggs**
Use 10 smart lights from different brands to plug and unplug them wildly to see if the system will "strike"; repeatedly switch the camera to verify whether the screen will "crack into PPT" - it is stricter than Party A's acceptance!
2. **Performance Test: Extreme Pressure**
Connect 50 devices at the same time to simulate "group chat" during peak periods; send commands frantically to test how many "critical hits" the system can withstand.If the delay exceeds 0.5 seconds, the code will have to be rebuilt!
3. **Stability Test: 24-hour marathon**
Let the system run for 3 days and 3 nights continuously, and the network, power outage, and equipment are removed in turn to see if it will collapse - a complete "devil training"!

### 2. Optimization Guide: Let the system "fly"
1. **Performance First Aid Kit**
Is the device search too slow?Add a "filter" to the algorithm and give priority to finding common devices; encryption is too time-consuming?If you change to a lightweight algorithm, not all data requires "top secret" treatment~
2. **Experience Upgrade Technique**
Voice control arrangement!Scream "I'm back home", and the lights, air conditioners and music will start automatically; add a "lazy mode" on the interface, and switch to the "watching movies" and "reading" scenes with one click. Lazy cancer patients are ecstatic!

### 3. Blood and tears experience & future brains
1. **Memoirs of Trapped in the Pit**
The protocol of a certain brand of smart sockets is like Tianshu, and it takes three days to understand it; excessive encryption causes system lag and almost "chased" by the product manager... Remember: compatibility and performance are always "love and kill each other"!
2. **Science Fiction Outlook**
In the future, the system may understand your "important meaning": turn off the lights automatically when you yawn, and turn off the lights automatically when the phone is low in battery... Maybe one day, home will really talk!

OK, all the real things are over!Developing smart homes is like using Lego. If you match each module correctly, you will gain a full sense of accomplishment~ If you encounter strange problems in development, please come to the comment section to complain and let‚Äôs overcome them together!üè†üí°
