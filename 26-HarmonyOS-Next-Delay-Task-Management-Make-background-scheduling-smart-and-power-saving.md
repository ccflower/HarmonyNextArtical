# HarmonyOS Next Delay Task Management: Make background scheduling "smart and power-saving"

hello!I am Xiao L, the female programmer who "fights with task dispatch" in the Hongmeng background~ Do you know?Through delayed task management, we can let the application "do the right thing at the right time" - the WiFi environment automatically synchronizes data, silently updates large files when charging, and "hibernate" when low battery!Today, letâ€™s reveal how HarmonyOS Next makes background tasks "obedient and sensible" and helps developers create "worry-saving and efficient" applications~


## 1. "Trigger Magic" of Delayed Mission: Conditional Combination Plays Flowers
### (I) Four elements of "environmental perception"
| Triggering conditions | Optional values/ranges | Typical scenarios |
|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Network Type | WIFI/CELLULAR/NONE | Automatically backup albums under WiFi only |
| Battery power | 0-100% | Clean the cache when the power is > 80% |
| Charging status | Wired/Wireless/Not Charging | Download offline map package while charging |
| Storage allowance | <1GB/> 10GB and other thresholds | Automatically clean up logs when there is insufficient storage space |

### (II) Example of "conditional superposition": "Seeking wealth and danger" mode
```typescript
const workInfo: WorkInfo = {
    workId: 9527,
networkType: NetworkType.WIFI, // must be connected to WiFi
batteryLevel: 30, // The battery capacity is less than 30%
chargerType: ChargingType.WIRED, // At the same time, wired charging
delayTime: 3600, // Delay 1 hour execution
requiredNetwork: true // Check the network before enforcement
};
```
**Scene Interpretation**: When setting up "Late Night Charging + WiFi Environment" for "Hikers Must Have" applications, you will automatically download the next day's hiking route, which will not waste traffic or consume batteries. You can be called a "time management master"!


## 2. The "survival rule" of task scheduling: "build a good relationship" with the system
### (I) Application of grouping "unwritten rules"
```mermaid
graph LR
A[User Opens App] --> B[Active Grouping]
A -->|Opened within 3 days|C[Frequently used grouping]
A -->|Opened within 7 days|D[Frequently used grouping]
A -->|Opened within 30 days|E[Seldom use grouping]
A -->|Never turned on| F[Restricted Grouping]
```
**Scheduling Priority**: Active Grouping > Frequently Used > Frequently Used > Very rarely Used > Restricted (Execution prohibited)

### (II) System "resource control" black technology
1. **When memory is tight**:
Pause all non-emergency tasks and give priority to ensuring the smoothness of front-end applications
   ```java
   if (MemoryManager.getFreeMemory() < MIN_MEMORY) {
WorkScheduler.pauseAll(); // Pause with one click
   }
   ```

2. **High temperature warning**:
Automatically delay high computing tasks to avoid "fever" the device
   ```c++
   if (ThermalManager.getTemperature() > HIGH_TEMP) {
WorkScheduler.delayTask(workId, 3600); // 1 hour delay
   }
   ```

3. **Night "Don't Disturb" mode**:
From 22:00 to 8:00 on the next day, non-emergency tasks will automatically enter "Silent Queuing"
   ```typescript
   const isNight = new Date().getHours() >= 22 || new Date().getHours() < 8;
   if (isNight && !workInfo.isUrgent) {
WorkScheduler.setQuietTime(workId, '08:00'); // Delay to 8 am to execute
   }
   ```


## 3. Practical case: "Lazy Operation and Maintenance" of "Smart Album"
### (I) Requirements disassembly
- **Core Scenario**: Automatic synchronization/backup/clear albums
- **User Pain Points**:
âœ˜ Synchronous waste of traffic under mobile network
âœ˜ Waste of idle resources while charging
âœ˜ Manual cleaning is troublesome and easy to forget

### (II) "Combination punch" for delayed tasks
#### 1. **Original synchronization of WiFi environment**
```typescript
const syncWork: WorkInfo = {
    workId: 1001,
    networkType: NetworkType.WIFI,
    abilityName: 'PhotoSyncAbility',
triggerCount: 3, // Try up to 3 times
retryDelay: 300 // Retry 5 minutes after failure
};
WorkScheduler.startWork(syncWork);
```

#### 2. **"Deep Cleanup" when charging**
```typescript
const cleanWork: WorkInfo = {
    workId: 1002,
chargerType: ChargingType.ANY, // Just charge
batteryLevel: 50, // Execute when the power is >50% (avoid the cleaning interruption when the power is low)
    abilityName: 'PhotoCleanAbility',
estimatedDuration: 600 // It takes 10 minutes
};
WorkScheduler.startWork(cleanWork);
```

#### 3. **Automatic Archive at the end of the month**
```typescript
const archiveWork: WorkInfo = {
    workId: 1003,
scheduledTime: '0 0 0 1 * *', // 0:00 on the 1st of the month
    networkType: NetworkType.WIFI,
    abilityName: 'PhotoArchiveAbility',
isPersisted: true // Continue to execute after restart
};
WorkScheduler.startWork(archiveWork);
```

### (III) Effect comparison
| Indicators | Traditional backend tasks | Delay task management | Improvement range |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Traffic consumption | 500MB per month | 80MB per month | 84% |
| Battery Loss | 5% per day | 1.2% per day | 76% |
| User Complaint Rate | 15 times/month | 2 times/month | 87% |


## 4. Avoiding pits: Make the mission "be good at obedience"
### (I) Cracking "Permission Trap"
1. **Location permissions**:
If the task depends on location information (such as "automatic push discounts entering the business district"), you need to apply for permission in advance, otherwise the task will "strike" silently.
   ```java
   if (!PermissionManager.checkPermission("ohos.permission.LOCATION")) {
WorkScheduler.abortWork(workId); // Terminate the task when permissions are insufficient
showPermissionDialog(); // Boot the user to authorize
   }
   ```

2. **Battery Optimization Whitelist**:
Some models will automatically clean up background tasks, and users need to be reminded to add the application to the "Battery Optimization Whitelist"
   ```typescript
   if (WorkScheduler.isWorkAborted(workId)) {
showBatteryOptimizationGuide(); // Pop up the guided bullet window
   }
   ```

### (II) "Parameter setting" metaphysics
1. **Delay time "Goldilocks Principle"**:
- Too short: frequent wake-up consumes power (such as <1 hour)
- Too long: users can't wait (such as >7 days)
**Best Practice**: Set the "User Unsensited" delay according to the scene (such as night synchronization is set to 3 hours later)

2. **triggerCount "Stop when you are ready"**:
Donâ€™t be too "stubborn" if you fail to try again!It is recommended to have up to 3 times, otherwise the system may be judged as a "rogue application"
   ```typescript
   workInfo.triggerCount = 3;
   workInfo.onRetry = (count) => {
       if (count >= 3) {
logError("Task failed multiple times, stop retrying");
       }
   };
   ```


## 5. Future Outlook: "Super Power Evolution" of Delayed Missions
### (I) "Collaborative Cross-device" scheduling
In the future, support "equipment teaming" to perform tasks!for example:
- When the mobile phone connects to WiFi, triggers the tablet to synchronize documents
- The watch detects that the user's movement ends, triggering the mobile phone to automatically backup the motion data
```mermaid
graph LR
A[Mobile phone connection WiFi] --> B[Trigger tablet task]
C[Watch ends exercise] --> D[Triggers mobile phone task]
```

### (II) "AI prediction" triggers
Combining user behavior data, automatically predict the best execution time!for example:
- Automatically adjust the task time according to user's work and rest (Night Owl's task is delayed until early morning)
- Predict the network congestion period and synchronize large files at peak staggered times

### (III) "Carbon Neutrality" Mode
Responding to the call for environmental protection, give priority to performing high-energy-consuming tasks in "green power period" (such as photovoltaic power peak) to help low-carbon life~


## Last reminder: The "Three Principles of Survival" for Delayed Tasks
**Efficiency = (correct time Ã— accurate conditions) Ã· Resource consumption**
- Time: Don't "disturb" when the user is busy (such as triggering notifications during the meeting)
- Conditions: Set "contradictory conditions" (such as "battery capacity <10%" and "charging" are required at the same time)
- Resource: Don't let the task "blut" (perform multiple high-energy-consuming tasks at once)
